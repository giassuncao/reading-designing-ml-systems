A repository to accompany my reading of the book "Designing Machine Learning Systems" by [Chip Huyen](https://github.com/chiphuyen), this is part of the coursework for the Machine Learning course by professor [Ivanovitch Medeiros](https://github.com/ivanovitchm).

The assignment was to read the first five chapters of the book "Designing Machine Learning Systems" by Chip Huyen and create five video presentations, one for each chapter, explaining its content and giving our point of view. (Note: The explanations on all videos are in portuguese, but I'm working on making available good english subtitles for the videos.)
